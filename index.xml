      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (preferably HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on the due date. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>

      <description>I think one of my favorite things about coding is that it really is another language. Personally, I find the idea of languages very fascinating. I think for me it’s how we associate meanings with certain symbols, sounds, and the order they come in. Python is no different. I find it interesting of how we can program a machine to solve problems, collect data and interpret it.
print(&amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;) ## Hello World Take the line of code above for example.</description>

      <description>Hello There! Welcome to my personal website! My name is Michael Nguyen. I am a third-year student the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a Bachelor of Science and Arts Degree in Biology. I made this website as a project for my Biostatistic course. It features two projects regarding Data Analysis and Modeling for data that I’ve found on the internet. I’ve also included my resume and personal social media on this site if you want to get to know a little more about me.</description>

      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Introduction I chose to study three data sets on crime rates, bad drivers, and state data. My bad drivers data set contains data on the percentage of bad drivers in each state a long with statistics such as if alcohol is involved or phone calls, as well as how much insurance premiums were raised. My crime rates data set contains data on the amount of prisoners a state has along with the times of crimes that were committed.</description>
