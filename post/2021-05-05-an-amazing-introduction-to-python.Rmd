I think one of my favorite things about coding is that it really is another language. Personally, I find the idea of languages very fascinating. I think for me it's how we associate meanings with certain symbols, sounds, and the order they come in. Python is no different. I find it interesting of how we can program a machine to solve problems, collect data and interpret it. 

```{python}
print("Hello World")
```

Take the line of code above for example. In plain english, I'm telling the machine to print the string "Hello World", but I have to write it in a certain syntax in order for the machine to understand that. But let's level up and look at another variation of this.

```{python}
a = "Hello World"
print(a)
```

Here we get the same output, but we obtained it a bit differently. This time I assigned my string "Hello World" to a variable and then printed the variable. This might not be obvious to someone not familiar with coding and coding syntax. Ok, one more time.

```{python}
a = "Hello "
b = "World"
print(a + b)
```
Finally, we have reached the same output from another pathway. Here I used two variables containing parts of the string and told the machine concatenate the two strings together. Again, this might not be as obvious to a person not familiar with programming languages.

Another reason why I think that programming languages are actual languages are because of how you can actually use two languages in conjunction with one another. Personally, I am a person who understands more than one langauge and sometimes a mixture of the two comes out when I'm communicating with others who also understand the same two languages I do. This is no different for two programming languages. Let's take the languages Python and R Studio for example.

```{R}
library(reticulate)
a <- "Hello "
```

So here I'm using R Studio to store the string "Hello " into the variable a.

```{python}
b = "World"
print(r.a + b)
```

And here, I'm storing the string "World" into the variable b in python. Even though I'm using two languages, I'm still able to create the string.

Eventually, as your proficiency with python and other programming languages increase you'll be able to write more complex algorithms, like this one.

```{python}
import random


def whatIsIt(x):
    if x == 0:
        return "Rock"
    elif x == 1:
        return "Paper"
    else:
        return "Scissors"


a = random.randint(0, 2)
b = random.randint(0, 2)
winner = ""

if a == b:
    winner = "Tie"
elif a == 0 and b == 1:
    winner = "Player B"
elif a == 0 and b == 2:
    winner = "Player A"
elif a == 1 and b == 0:
    winner = "Player A"
elif a == 1 and b == 2:
    winner = "Player B"
elif a == 2 and b == 0:
    winner = "Player B"
elif a == 2 and b == 1:
    winner = "Player A"

print("Player A chose " + whatIsIt(a) + "\nPlayer B chose " + whatIsIt(b) + '\n' + "\nWinner: " + winner)

```
This program is a simulated game of Rock, Paper, Scissors :)
