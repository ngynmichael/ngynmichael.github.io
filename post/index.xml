      <description>I think one of my favorite things about coding is that it really is another language. Personally, I find the idea of languages very fascinating. I think for me it’s how we associate meanings with certain symbols, sounds, and the order they come in. Python is no different. I find it interesting of how we can program a machine to solve problems, collect data and interpret it.
print(&amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;) ## Hello World Take the line of code above for example.</description>

      <description>Hello There! Welcome to my personal website! My name is Michael Nguyen. I am a third-year student the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a Bachelor of Science and Arts Degree in Biology. I made this website as a project for my Biostatistic course. It features two projects regarding Data Analysis and Modeling for data that I’ve found on the internet.
